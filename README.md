AndroidKioskMode
================

Library for handling Kiosk Mode in your Android Application.

Features:
---------

* Run activity of you choice in kiosk mode
* Blocks every application from going into foreground with activity manager (soon: support for whitelisted apps)
* Handles home button by being a Launcher App
* Work from API level 11

How to Use:
-----------

1. Extend your activity from KioskActivity
2. Add your activity declaraction in AndroidManifest.xml with following additions:

```
  <activity
      android:name=".ExampleKioskActivity"
      android:enabled="false"
      android:launchMode="singleTask"
      android:stateNotNeeded="true">
      <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
          <category android:name="android.intent.category.HOME" />
          <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
      </intent-filter>
  </activity>
```
intent filters is for handling home button. Remember to set stateNotNeeded, launchMode and enabled properties as in example above. Activity has to be disabled in order to default launcher to work normaly. Only while kiosk activity is being started it is being turned on by library and handles home button.
3. Start activity with call KioskActivity.startKioskActivity().
